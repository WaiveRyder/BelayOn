            <h2>What is BelayOn?</h2>
            <P>To put it simply, BelayOn is a member management tool designed for the modern climbing gym.</P>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                BelayOn's purpose is to help staff keep track of their members and guests efficiently, allowing guests to
                spend more time climbing and staff more time with guests.
            </p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>
                By increasing the speed of guest and member checkins not only do guests get maximum time enjoying the gym
                experience, but staff has more time for safety, orientations, and membership conversions.
